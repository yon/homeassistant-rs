# Python Integration Allowlist
#
# This file controls which Python integrations are allowed to load.
# Copy this file to your HA config directory as 'ha_python_integration_allowlist.yaml'.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - If this file doesn't exist, ALL Python integrations are blocked
# - Components implemented in Rust are ALWAYS blocked (regardless of this list):
#   automation, homeassistant, input_boolean, input_number,
#   persistent_notification, script, system_log
#
# Usage:
# - List integration domains you want to load via Python
# - Add integrations one at a time and test each
# - Start with simple integrations that have few dependencies

integrations:
  # Tested integrations (verified working):
  - sun              # No external deps
  - uptime           # No external deps

  # Common integrations (untested):
  # - homekit_controller
  # - apple_tv
  # - esphome
  # - hue
